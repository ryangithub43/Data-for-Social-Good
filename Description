## Describe your project

Our project contains a program that runs the data of 149 participants and what their order is at a pizza restaurant. In the code, the text files contain the size of the order, the name of the pizza ordered, the ingredients within the pizza, and the cost of the pizza. The goal that the program should achieve is to learn more about our frequent visitors so we can provide better recommendations. 

There are 2 classes: UserStory and RestaurantData

RestaurantData contains the instance variables that are created, and accessed by the UserStory. In the UserStory class, file readers are used to collect data and turn the lines into an index. 

There's also a method called checkForDuplicates that prevent duplicates from printing in the console. 

The text files are: name.txt, price.txt, size.txt, ingredients.txt 

## What are you most proud of?

I didn't have much difficulty in creating the program because of the resources available, so I would say I'm proud of how fast and efficient the program was written.
